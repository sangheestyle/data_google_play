    "description": "Sister Sledge Video ApplicationSister Sledge is an American musical group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formed in 1971 and consisting of four sisters: Kim Sledge (born August 21, 1957), Debbie Sledge (born July 9, 1954), Joni Sledge (born September 13, 1956), and Kathy Sledge (born January 6, 1959). They are granddaughters of the former opera singer Viola Williams. The sisters used to perform under the name of \"Mrs. Williams' Grandchildren\". The group is best known for their hit songs \"We Are Family\", \"He's the Greatest Dancer\", and \"Frankie\".This application allows you to simply ask, and quickly find and view videos from those groups that you love! Application size is very small, but it contains a large amount of video that is periodically adds.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
