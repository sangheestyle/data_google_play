    "description": "Puhdys Clips Video ApplicationThe Puhdys are a veteran German rock band, formed in Oranienburg (Brandenburg), in what was then the German Democratic Republic, in 1969, although they had been performing together, with various lineups, as the Puhdys since 1965. They continue to record and tour. Although they are especially popular in their native eastern Germany, the Puhdys enjoyed significant success outside the GDR, and were one of the first East German bands allowed to tour West Germany. They are one of the most successful German-language rock groups.This application allows you to simply ask, and quickly find and view videos from those groups that you love! Application size is very small, but it contains a large amount of video that is periodically adds.This app will add a few search access points on your device. If you do not want to use this new search page, you can either ignore it or delete it. If you do use it, we get a few cents and it will help us a lot to keep developing more apps. If you donât, you can delete it and no harm is done (our app remains the same, no need to uninstall it!). Thank you.",
