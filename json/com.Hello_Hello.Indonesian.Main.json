Our lessons are structured to give learners the ability to communicate effectively with others.  If the learner is new to the language, it will be necessary to spend more time learning the basic phrases in order to begin to gain proficiency in the language.  For those who already know other related languages, the time factor may not be as great to learn the basics. Beginners need to go slowly and may need to do the activities several times before they gain a comfort level in using them. And remember: The more time you spend doing the exercises, the more proficient you will become!CONTACT US:  We are constantly trying to improve the app and take feedback from our users very seriously.
